# PKHeXPluginExample

An example project that compiles a .dll compatible with [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX)'s plugin loader.

To ensure the plugin loads correctly, be sure to rename the assembly, namespace, and class name of your new plugin such that they are unique to other plugins you may end up loading.
