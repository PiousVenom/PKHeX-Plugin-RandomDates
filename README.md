# About  
This project uses `PKHeX.Core` and PKHeX's `IPlugin` interface to add enhancements to the PKHeX program, primarily the ability to randomize the `Met Date` and `Egg Met Date` of Pokémon with respect to the Game Version release date!

This project is owned by [@PiousVenom](https://github.com/PiousVenom) (Discord: PiousVenom#0867).

## Building  
This project requires an IDE that supports compiling .NET 6 based code. Recommended IDE is Visual Studio 2022.

## Usage  
To use the plugins:
- Create a folder named `plugins` in the same directory as PKHeX.exe.
- Put the compiled plugins from this project in the `plugins` folder. 
- Start PKHeX.exe.
- The plugins should be available for use in `Tools > Pokémon Date Randomizer` drop-down menu.

## Support Server

**Credit must be given where due...**
This project would not be as amazing without the existence of PKHeX.

- [@kwsch](https://github.com/kwsch) for providing the IPlugin interface in PKHeX, which allows loading of this project's Plugin DLL files. Also for the support provided in the support server.
- [architdate (thecommondude)](https://github.com/architdate) for providing a great repo and plugin, [Auto-Legality-Mod](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Auto-Legality-Mod), that I was able to use as an example to try my hand at this.
